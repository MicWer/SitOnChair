# SitOnChair Project
Complete Web Development Showcase including HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

First simple website in my life made with semantic order.
https://micwer.github.io/SitOnChair/

For the first time i had to build a website from ground zero, having only a screenshot of prototype. Most troubling thing was to create a proper working carousel slider, validation of the form was tricky too for my neat experience in JavaScript, but i managed to finish the page as it was told to do. Hope you enjoy clicking. :)

All the links will guide you somewhere inside or outside the page - don't be afraid to check it out.

Recently I've added some simple CSS animations for buttons and couple of div's - I hope you like them.
